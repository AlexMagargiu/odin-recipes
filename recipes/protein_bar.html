    <h1>Protein Bar</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I came up with this recipe when my doctor told me 
        I needed to eat more fiber, and I was sick of eating 
        store-bought protein bars for breakfast in the car 
        between the gym and work. Ingredients such as wheat 
        germ, flaxseed, protein powder, peanut butter, and oats 
        make this a healthy way to start the day!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups quick-cooking oats</li>
        <li>¼ cup wheat germ</li>
        <li>¼ cup ground flax seed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vanilla-flavored hemp protein powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 bananas</li>
        <li>¼ cup peanut butter (such as Jif®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup natural peanut butter, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with aluminum foil, 
            letting foil hang down over the sides of the pan; 
            spray pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Stir oats, wheat germ, flax seed, protein powder, 
            cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Mash bananas 
            in a separate large bowl and stir 1/4 cup Jif 
            peanut butter, honey, and vanilla extract into 
            bananas, mixing well. Stir dry ingredients into 
            banana mixture and spread into the prepared baking 
            dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. 
            Spread 1/4 cup natural peanut butter over top.</li>
        <li>Continue baking until lightly browned on the 
            edges and set, 10 more minutes. Let cool in the 
            pan and lift bars onto a work surface using 
            aluminum foil as handles. Cut into bars, wrap 
            in plastic wrap, and store in refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
